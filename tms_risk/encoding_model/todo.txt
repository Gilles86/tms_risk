10, ses-1: glm ran again, now encode/decode
45, ses-2: fmriprep running again, then glm, then encode/decode
72, ses-2: fmriprep running again, then glm, then encode/decode



# Subject 45 had a run 1 that had only 1 volumes. Fmriprep is currently running


# Subject 62 crashed when optimizing because of a bug in braincoder (now fixed).

# Subject 72 had a problem with the 6th run of the 2nd session. Fmriprep is running again.
