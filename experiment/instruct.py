        Hi!

        Welcome to the instruction part of the experiment. During this part, we will explain what a single trial in this experiment looks like, and what choices you can make.

        First of all, during the experiment, you will always have 4 buttons that you can press.

        On this computer, these are:
        * the j-key (index finger)
        * the k-key (middle finger)

        TIP: let your index-/middle-/ring-finger and pinky lie down on these keys during the experiment. Note that, on the computer, key 1 (j) has a little bar on top that you can feel.

        In the scanner, there will be a red, blue, yellow, and green key.

        From now on, we will call them key 1 (index finger), key 2 (middle finger).

        Press key 1 to continue.
